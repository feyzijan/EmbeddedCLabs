This is a collection of the codes I've written for my Embedded C for Microcontroller labs.
Each Lab has the original instruction Readme file with explanations and commented codes.

Lab 2: Digital & Analog Input and Output
Lab 3: Timers and Interrupts
Lab 4: LCD & Pointers in C
Lab 5: Serial Communication
Lab 6: DC Motors and PWM

Two projects associated with the course are in the repos:
